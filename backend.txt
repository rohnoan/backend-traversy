1)learned about overview of backend

2) expressjs and starting a server and deploying it
express js syntax
learned about .env file and all the crucial data it stores


    computer/mobile <- [connected through express] -> server

    listen - listening 
    / home router
    requests - get
    
    express- a web framework

    A server in the backend is a system (hardware or software) that processes requests from clients (such as browsers or mobile apps) and returns responses.

    servers are all about responses and requests.
    learned about .gitignore

    express has req and res

3)frontend+backend
    created an api in a server 
    made frontend use it
    learned about CORS(cross origin)
    learned about proxy to resolve cors errors

    bad practice-pushing your whole bakcend and frotnend code in digital ocean/render or any server hosting apps

4)taking backend to next level
    overview

5)data modelling with mongoose
    pehle pen aur paper leke define kr database model kese banega

    boilerplate for mongoose ->
        import mongoose from "mongoose";
        const userSchema= new mongoose.Schema({...})
        export const User = mongoose.model("User",userSchemas)

    to use data from some other file use-
        createdBy: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'User',
        },
    
    2 ways to define
        i)username:String,
            email:String,
            isActive:boolean
        ii)username:{
            type:String,
            required:true,
            unique:true,
            lowercase:true
            },
            email:{
            type:String,
            required:true,
            unique:true,
            lowercase:true,
            },
            password:{
            type:String,
            required:[true,"password is required"],
            
            }
