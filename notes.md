    callbacks 
    promises 
    async await

    synchronous-
        u dont wan wait until its done (one after other)
    asynchronous-
        u want it to work parallely
    
    callbacks-
        it just says after youre finished with this do this next.

    promises-
        "I promise to do something. If I succeed, I'll tell you (resolve). If I fail, I'll also tell you (reject)."

        promise.all() - Promise.all() takes an array of promises and waits for all of them to complete.

    async await
        async/await is a way to handle tasks that take time (like fetching data, saving something, etc.) without stopping the rest of your code.
